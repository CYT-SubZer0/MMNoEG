Murder Mystery Game. Anybody other than No Effirt Games Dev Team will not be allowed.
Ok, not gonna lie, this one's gonna be long:

Hello @No Effirt Developer So, we’ve had a slight change of plans. We’re not doing a remake of SCP: Secret Laboratory, instead we are making a Murder Mystery game, but we’re putting another twist to it. This isn’t like your normal MM game, so here are the classes and their objectives (from lowest to highest power):
Civilian (Partygoer): Literally does nothing other than stay alive and act as distractions and civilians. Only very few will spawn with kitchen knives in the kitchen.

Host: Keeps order among partygoers. Has a concealed pocket knife and can access all parts of the house. Mainly tries to stop all violence.

VIP (Target): Aware that they’re being chased / hunted, only has access to normal rooms and tries to survive for 15 minutes to win the game and leave the party. Is hunted by 2 parties and is escorted out by friendly teams (hunters, sheriff + deputy, FBI, and end-game SWAT) if a weapon is used. Has a concealed carry pistol (slow draw time) and a switchblade.
Hunters: The hunters are people spawned in the deep woods. They can win without doing anything but usually want to try to kill hunting party 2 and escort the VIP out if needed. Spawn either with bows, crossbows, bolt action hunting rifles (), or semi-auto hunting rifles (ex. M1 Garand or SVT-40). Usually also have a sharp hiding / stripping knife and a pistol (Buck Mark). Spawns either in woods or at lodge.

Hunting Party 1: Main goal to kill the VIP and survive for 15 minutes after and escape to getaway van. Consists of one person only with a concealed carry pistol (XD-9) and a saxe knife. Also tries to kill the 2nd hunting party. If the VIP is killed by the 2nd hunting party, hunting party 1’s main goal is to kill hunting party 2 and survive for 7 minutes. Spawns inside the party.

Hunting Party 2: Main goal to kill the VIP and survive for 15 minutes after and escape to a getaway van. Consists of a woodlands sniper and a spy. The spy gives information on where the VIP is and only carries a concealed carry pistol (XD-9) and a small switchblade. The spy has a radio that is quiet loud but can be adjusted and must only be seen in private (can be easily recognized and killed by civilians, friendly forces). The sniper spawns with a bolt-action sniper (M24) and a pistol (Strike One or Glock 18). The sniper’s goal is to stay alive and hidden while killing the VIP and/or Hunting Party 1. The sniper has to stay alive while being hunted by the hunters and friendly forces. The team will live on If one of the two is killed.
Sheriff and Deputy (Detectives): The sheriff and deputy are the first wave of inspectors after a weapon is shot or the police are called by a civilian with a phone or the host. These two can be armed with a variety of weapons depending on the situation they are called in on (ex. Fist fighting call will not get a rifle, but armed fighting will). They can be armed with rifles (M4A1, etc), close-quarters shotguns (Stakeout, SPAS-12), pistols (Glock 18 standard), knives (standard police knife), and other tools useful such as a flashlight, a taser, an attachable non-lethal bullet bolt-on, rubber bullet rounds, a baton, and handcuffs. Spawns at 3 minutes if called upon.

Local Area Police Enforcers: Larger group (up to 6) does the exact same job with the exact same weapons as the sheriff and deputy. Meant to be a reinforcement force. Spawns at 7 minutes if called upon.

FBI: Small group (up to 4) that protects the VIP and escorts him/her out. They have a very large palette of weapons available and therefore are the mark of an almost over game. They also search for both hunting parties by gathering clues to find a trail. Spawns at 10 minutes if called upon.

SWAT: This team has the largest selection of weapons and tries to stop the hunting parties and keep the VIP alive. The only way players can spawn as these are if the game is at 25+ minutes (VIP hiding and not leaving) after called upon. Marks the near end of a round of 30 minutes.
Okay, now that we got the longest part of the message out of the way, I need to explain a few things.

1) You will be able to pick up almost everything, including utensils from the kitchen, guns, clothes, etc. (even from dead people but will take some time).

2) You can carry 2 weapons at a time and can dual wield. You can dual wield a pistol and a larger gun, using left click as left weapon and vice versa, however, the larger gun may fall while firing or you may have to set it down or cannot raise it up all the way. Shooting a large gun one handed will result in a lot of recoil and inaccuracy.

3) Leaning, sprinting, walking, and slow walking (creeping) will be able in all three stances (standing, crouching, and proning). While crouching, you will automatically go on one knee while still. This can be disabled in the settings.

4) Maps will be large and rounds can last up to 30 minutes maximum with a 20 minute game average.

5) The game can be extended if the VIP doesn’t go to their car / leave with someone else. If the VIP stays in the house for 30 minutes without anyone finding them and at least one hunting party is still alive, the game will be called a draw and the game restarted.
